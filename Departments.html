                <p>The Department of Computer Science has since in 2007 been training students in Higher National Diploma programme. The Department trains students in various fields of computing that equips them with knowledge for development and utilization of modern computing.

                <li>Department of Information Science</li>
                <p>Information is a key resource for individual, organizational, national and international development. It must, therefore, be generated, processed, stored, and disseminated. The University decided to create this department in 2015 under the Faculty of Applied Science to train people to manage the various libraries and information centres in the country  and  beyond.</p>
                <li>Department of Mathematical Science </li>
                <p>The Department of Mathematical Sciences is one of the four departments under the Faculty of Applied Sciences and Technology. The department has always maintained an old philosophy that “If you cant count or measure it, you can’t manage it” therefore our activities affect all policies, and touch all aspects of people’s lives.</p>
